    "# Cross Language Information Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build a cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, will be capable of searching text documents written in English and displaying the results in German.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use machine translation, information retrieval using a vector space model, and then assess the performance of the system using IR evaluation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts of the project are explained as we progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- bitext.(en,de): A sentence aligned, parallel German-English corpus, sourced from the Europarl corpus (which is a collection of debates held in the EU parliament over a number of years). We'll use this to develop word-alignment tools, and build a translation probability table. \n",
    "\n",
    "- newstest.(en,de): A separate, smaller parallel corpus for evaulation of the translation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- devel.(docs,queries,qrel): A set of documents in English (sourced from Wikipedia), queries in German, and relevance judgement scores for each query-document pair. \n",
    "\n",
    "The files are available to check out in the data/clir directory of the repo. "
